# Firebase Security Rules Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a race condition in Firebase that can occur when dealing with security rules and asynchronous operations.  The issue arises when attempting to update data based on the result of an asynchronous read operation, without properly handling potential delays or race conditions.

## Problem Description

The primary issue stems from the asynchronous nature of Firebase's data retrieval. The `once('value')` function completes asynchronously. If the update operation is performed before the `once('value')` callback has finished and the data has been read, then it might lead to security rule violations due to not having sufficient permission.
